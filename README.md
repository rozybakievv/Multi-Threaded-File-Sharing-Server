# Multi-Threaded File Sharing Server & File System Simulator
Project to simulate a multi-threaded file sharing server in Java in a single file.

## Features

- Custom file system simulator stored in a single file

- File operations: CREATE, READ, WRITE, DELETE, LIST

- Fixed-size block allocation with linked file nodes

- Multi-client server using Java sockets and multithreading

- Reader–writer synchronization to allow concurrent reads and exclusive writes

- Error handling to prevent file system corruption

- Designed to scale to hundreds of simultaneous client connections

Key operating system concepts: file allocation, metadata management, concurrency control, synchronization, and deadlock prevention.
